# Two Stream Action Recognition on Windows 10 Python 3.6 

spatial and motion stream cnn with ResNet101 for modeling video information in UCF101 dataset

The code from https://github.com/jeffreyhuang1/two-stream-action-recognition is modified to work on Windows 10

You can download the UCF101 data from https://github.com/feichtenhofer/twostreamfusion and change the folder locations the code wherever applicaple

I successfully tested it by installing PyTorch in Anaconda Python 3.6 Environment. Install the missing packages with pip and you should be good to go. Feel free to reach out if you face any issues configuring the environment
